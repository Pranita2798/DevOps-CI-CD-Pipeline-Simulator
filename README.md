## 🎯 Usage

### Running Pipeline Simulations

1. **Trigger a New Pipeline**
   - Click the "Trigger Pipeline" button in the main dashboard
   - Watch as the pipeline progresses through each stage automatically
   - Monitor real-time status updates and duration tracking

2. **View Pipeline Details**
   - Click on any pipeline card to expand stage details
   - Access logs for each stage by clicking the "Logs" button
   - Monitor command execution and output in real-time

3. **Pipeline Stages**
   - **Build**: Simulates dependency installation and application building
   - **Test**: Runs unit tests and coverage analysis
   - **Security Scan**: Performs security vulnerability scanning
   - **Deploy**: Handles containerization and deployment to target environment

### Statistics and Analytics

Access the Statistics tab to view:
- Total pipeline runs and success rates
- Average pipeline duration metrics
- Failure rate analysis with trend indicators
- Performance charts and visual analytics

### Configuration Management

Use the Settings tab to configure:
- Auto-trigger on repository push events
- Email notification preferences
- Parallel job execution limits
- Pipeline timeout settings
- Retry attempts for failed stages
- Target deployment environment
